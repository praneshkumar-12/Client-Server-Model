Hi, Thanks for downloading my code. 
This is a client-server model which works by socket programming in python. 
Change the ip address of the server in both the client.py and server.py files and also change the port accordingly.
This client-server model is a 2 way connection, in the background, but the client and the server can communicate only one way virtually. 
That is, the client sends a message to the server and the server will be displaying the message on the screen with the nickname of the client, which is got at run time.
Multiple simultaneous connections are allowed to the server. 
If any client connects or disconnects from the server, appropriate messages are shown on the server side with the corresponding client's ip address. 
Let me know if there are any issues with my code. 
Thanks!
